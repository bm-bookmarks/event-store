Malocher EventStore
===================
The Malocher EventStore provides infrastructure to use Event Sourcing as storage mechanism within a DDD project.
It depends on components of the [malocher\cqrs-esb](https://github.com/malocher/cqrs-esb) library, 
but do not require a CQRS sytem to be used. However, both systems can be linked very easy.
